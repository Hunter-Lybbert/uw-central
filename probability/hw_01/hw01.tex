\noindent {\bf 1.} Describe the probability space for the following experiments: a) a biased coin is tossed three times; b)  two balls are drawn without replacement from an urn which originally contained two blue and two red balls. \\
a) \textit{ Solution} \\
Actual math here \\
b) \textit{ Solution} \\
Actual math here \\

\noindent {\bf 2.} (No translation-invariant random integer). Show that there is no probability measure $P$ on the integers $\mathds{Z}$ with the discrete
$\sigma$-algebra $2^{\mathds{Z}}$ with the translation-invariance property $P(E + n) = P(E)$ for every event $E \in 2^{\mathds{Z}}$ and every integer $n$. $E+n$ is obtained by adding $n$ to every element of $E$.
\\
\textit{ Solution} \\
Show by contradiction, eventually $P(\Omega) = 0$ but it should be 1 \\

\noindent {\bf 3.}  (No translation-invariant random real). Show that there is no probability measure $P$ on the reals $\mathds{R}$ with the Borel
$\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{B}(\mathds{R})$ with the translation-invariance property $P(E + x) = P(E)$ for every event $E \in \mathcal{B}(\mathds{R})$ and every real $x$. Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{B}(\mathds{R})$ is the $\sigma$-algebra generated by intervals $(a,b] \subset \mathds{R}$.
\\
\textit{ Solution} \\
Also show by contradiction but it is a little trickier. It has to composing the right $x$ s.t. $E + x$ is outside the interval $(a, b]$.\\

\noindent {\bf 4.} Let $\Omega=\mathds{R}$, $\mathcal{F}=$ all subsets of $\mathds{R}$ so that $A$ or $A^c$ is countable. Let $P(A)=0$ in the first case and $P(A)=1$ in the second. Show that $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ is a probability space.
\textit{ Solution} \\
We want to prove something is a probability space. Therefore, we need to prove the following: \\
(1) prove fancy $\mathcal{F}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra which includes that it contains the compliments of each set and that it contains the union of two sets. \\
(2) prove cap P is a probability measure which includes proving 
$P(\Omega) = 1$, $P(A) \geq P(\emptyset) = 0 \quad \forall A \in \mathcal{F}$, 
and that $P(\cup_i A_i) = \sum_i P(A_i)$ for $A_i \in \mathcal{F}$ 
that is a countable sequence of disjoint sets.
